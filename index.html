	<h1>Hey there!!!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my website. Currently it's a work in progress.</p>
	<p class="update">Update: still in progress...updating every 6 months :))
	<p>
	<p>Just like my learning. I want to be a web dev.</p>
	<p class="update">Update: this is still in progress...making some progress, but not quite towards web dev as a code
		writer; but learning so much about all the ecosystem
	<p>
	<p>So this here will be my personal projects.</p>
	<p class="update">Update: nothing to show so far :(
	<p>
	<p>If it looks nice and has some interesting links, it means i'm getting there.</p>
	<p class="update">Update: trying to put something here to browser; i'll try harder
		<p>
	<p>If not...nah, not gonna talk about that.</p>
	<p>Anyway, if you're here and want to follow my journey, i will sometimes post on my <del>blog</del>.</p>
	<p class="update">Update 2: my rpi server broke and i don't have a blog anymore... ANOTHER DAY...maybe
	<p>
	<p class="update">Update: didn't start posting so far...it's been 3 months. One day. ONE DAY!
	<p>
	<p>I might even resume streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/haidook">twitch</a> at one point.</p>
	<p class="update">Update 2: the chance is up to 15% if i do at least one stream until de end of the year</p>
	<p class="update">Update: hah...would be nice, but i give this one a 5% chance</p>
	<p>Or just take a look at my ramblings on <del>Fosstodon</del>.</p>
	<p class="update">Update 2: yeah, no more social for me...other stuff to do</p>
	<p class="update">Update: i kinda quit all social media. I'm not randomly browsing anymore. Just some newsletters. Not
		even checking HackerNews that often. Like once a week. I might link some nice newsletters here at one point.</p>
	<h3>Thank you for passing by!</h3>
