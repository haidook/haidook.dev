      <description>Background On my old website version i had a bookshelf page where i put the books i read. It was a fancy way of tracking the books i read, aside from using literal.club.
For some good years now, i&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking1 lots of stuff. From tv-shows watched to hours slept and from bike rides to read books. The book tracking is kinda recent&amp;hellip;or not. I just checked my goodreads and my first book is from 2015.</description>
